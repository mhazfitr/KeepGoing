# KeepGoing
I leave this message here raw, little pauses here and there, but that is all.
Line by line I have grown tired of a past lifestyle and mental mansion I didn't enjoy living in.
Here is something I put up, so that one day I can look back and know how it felt to always be at the bottom, and to remind myself of where I was once I go up, and I will go up.
In the Name of God, 2025.
